<p> Here are the things you need to know if you want to succeed this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>One or more philosophers sit at a round table.</li>
<li>There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.</li>
<li> The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.</li>
<li> While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping; while thinking,they are not eating nor sleeping; and, of course,while sleeping,they are not eating nor thinking.</li>
<li> There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.</li>
<li> Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient,a philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.</li>
<li> When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.</li>
<li> Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.</li>
<li> Philosophers don’t speak with each other.</li>
<li> Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.</li>
<li> No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!</li>
</ul>
